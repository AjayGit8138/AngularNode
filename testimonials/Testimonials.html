                                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

                                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
